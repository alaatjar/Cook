<h1>About us</h1>
<p>Hi! We're Team Cooking . When you visit our corner of the internet, we want you to feel comfortable.
    <br>Like did we just become best friends?! kind of comfortable. We're not here to shame you into making
    <br>beef bourguignon when all you really want is Fireball meatballs. And if you do attempt that fancy-shmancy dish and fail spectacularly. </p>

<br>
    <p> That's not to say we're not serious about food. If you've come here to finally tackle an exasperatingly
        <br> intense sourdough recipe, we can help explain the technique, step by step. We celebrate anyone
         <br>who really loves to eat as much as those who actually get in the kitchen to cook. So wherever you fall on that spectrum,
          <br>you'll find your people here.
        
        
        </p>
